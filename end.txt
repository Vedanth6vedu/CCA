“I created a Git repository with two initial files in the main branch and committed them. I made further changes and pushed again. Then I created a feature branch, made some updates, and pushed it. On GitHub, a pull request was suggested, which I merged back into my main branch locally. After that, I made a final update in main by adding a new file and pushed it. I also added tags for each commit to mark different milestones. This workflow demonstrates core Git concepts: branching, merging, committing, pushing, tagging, and adding new files. yoyo
